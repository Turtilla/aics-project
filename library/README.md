Here you can find the list of required libraries that should be installed for the project code to run. As far as MLTGPU is concerned, you have to make sure that your Torch version is 1.11 to avoid errors.  

We highly recommend using a virtual environment. Having created and activated one, e.g. using ``python3 -m virtualenv ./aics_venv`` or whatever location or virtual environment tool that you prefer, navigate to this folder and run ``pip3 install -r requirements.txt`` in the command line. This should automatically install all the required libraries.   

This was created by Dominik, with small changes (adding libraries, adapting it to work with MLTGPU-imposed requirements) by Maria.
